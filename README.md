‚öôÔ∏è Technical Explanation

1. Data Preprocessing:

Standardization: Used StandardScaler to normalize features, improving model convergence and stability.

Handling Missing Data: Ensured data integrity by checking for missing values and outliers.

Train-Test Split: Divided data into 80% training and 20% testing to evaluate model performance accurately.

2. Model Development:

Activation Functions:

ReLU: Chosen for hidden layers to introduce non-linearity and prevent vanishing gradients.

Sigmoid: Applied in the output layer for binary classification (breast cancer, diabetes predictions).

Softmax: Used for multi-class classification in the MNIST dataset.

Optimization Algorithm: Adam optimizer was selected for its adaptive learning rate and efficient performance.

Loss Functions:

Binary Crossentropy: For binary classification tasks (diabetes and breast cancer).

Categorical Crossentropy: For multi-class classification (MNIST dataset).

3. Model Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Primary metric to evaluate the correct classification rate.

Precision & Recall: Important for imbalanced datasets like healthcare, where false positives/negatives matter.

F1-Score: Provides a balance between precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix: Visualizes model performance, highlighting TP, TN, FP, FN.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:

Experimented with different numbers of hidden layers, neurons, learning rates, and batch sizes to optimize performance.

Adjusted the number of epochs based on validation performance to prevent overfitting.

5. Business & Clinical Impact:

Diabetes Model: Aids early diagnosis and management strategies, reducing healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes.

Breast Cancer Model: Supports early detection, leading to timely treatment and higher survival rates.
